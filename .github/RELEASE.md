# Public GitHub releases

## Scope and status

`ci.yml` and `security.yml` run ordinary push/PR checks and provide the shared quality gates for `release.yml`. Release branch pushes and tags do not trigger duplicate checks. Client tests run on Linux and Windows; source HTTP startup checks run on all three operating systems. The PostgreSQL job checks migrations, schema drift, backup and restore using a disposable database.

**Draft release** defaults to the combined Client + Hub path, with source, Client and Hub subsets for diagnostics. Client and Hub preflight fails while `PUBLIC-SOURCE.json` sets `sourceOnly: true`, any item in `third-party/public-release.json` is pending, or previous-installer baselines are missing. The source path does not depend on these gates. `SODUWORK_INTERNAL_BUILD` cannot bypass publication gates. Workflow source does not establish a successful GitHub-hosted run.

| Component | Build and acceptance | GitHub Release assets |
| --- | --- | --- |
| source | Export the committed tree; verify the file inventory, public boundary and shared quality gates | Source ZIP without Git history |
| client | Windows fresh installation, repair, upgrade and compatibility; Mac DMG, signature, restart and upgrade; installation, startup, upgrade and removal in Ubuntu 22/24 and Rocky 9 containers | Windows x64 EXE, Linux x64 DEB/RPM/tar.gz, Mac ARM64/x64 DMG |
| hub | Shared self-hosting Dockerfile; disposable PostgreSQL, migrations, baked release identity, health/readiness, frontend assets, Pi/Codex versions, Runner entrypoint, non-root writable directories, restart, image export and reload | Linux amd64 Docker image tar.gz |

Hub release and Compose builds share `ops/self-host/Dockerfile`; the former
`Dockerfile.server` has been consolidated into it. GitHub builds the inline `deps`
stage and supplies the commit, version and intended tag as build arguments. Acceptance
checks the image's own identity without overriding it at startup. Original Pi and
Codex license snapshots are shipped under `/srv/app/third-party/licenses`, with
version-specific source references and digests in `third-party/manifest.json`.
The receipt records the CLI versions and verifies the notices are present.
These probes do not authenticate providers, enroll a Runner or execute model tasks.
The image still starts only the Hub and runs as UID/GID 10001. Existing clusters
need separate data-volume permission, database and Runner compatibility checks.

Automated acceptance does not cover interactive Windows UAC or customer filesystem filters. Public macOS builds require a Developer ID Application identity, hardened runtime, notarization and a real login Keychain smoke test. The manual package-validation workflow intentionally keeps ad-hoc signatures and mock Keychain isolation; those artifacts are never eligible for publication. Hub acceptance uses one isolated node, without production deployment, real-model calls or browser interaction certification. Receipts record these limitations.

The Intel macOS release job applies GitHub's temporary [Apple ticket networking workaround](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/14924): it blocks outbound UDP port 443 on the disposable runner so ticket downloads use HTTPS over TCP. This covers both stapling and acceptance validation; notarization, signatures and ticket checks remain required. The rule is confined to that runner and is not included in the shipped client.

Before running the public Client release, configure these repository or environment secrets: `SODUWORK_MAC_CERTIFICATE_B64`, `SODUWORK_MAC_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `SODUWORK_MAC_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`, `SODUWORK_MAC_SIGN_IDENTITY`, `SODUWORK_MAC_NOTARY_KEY_ID`, `SODUWORK_MAC_NOTARY_ISSUER` and `SODUWORK_MAC_NOTARY_PRIVATE_KEY_B64`. The workflow imports the Developer ID certificate into an ephemeral keychain, stores the `notarytool` profile, and removes both after the job. It appends this keychain to the existing search list so the login Keychain remains accessible, then restores the original list on cleanup or a preparation failure. The release build fails closed when the identity is missing or notarization is disabled. The runner must also be logged into a disposable macOS account whose login Keychain can authorize the signed application; release acceptance sets `SODUWORK_MAC_REAL_KEYCHAIN=1` and writes synthetic ciphertext into an isolated profile and requires later restart and upgrade processes to decrypt those same bytes. Missing, corrupt or unreadable ciphertext fails acceptance instead of being replaced.

For migration from an older ad-hoc-signed macOS release, its reviewed baseline entry may explicitly set `notarization: "legacy-ad-hoc"`. Acceptance verifies its SoduWork identity, older version, exact artifact path and pinned SHA-256 before extraction, then still requires a strict bundle signature. Only that old baseline is exempt from Gatekeeper and stapled-ticket checks, and the exception is recorded in the receipt. New candidate packages always require both checks. Do not mark the candidate as a legacy baseline.

## Repository setup

To validate packaging before publication approval, set `PACKAGE_VALIDATION_REPOSITORY`
to this repository's `owner/name` and manually run **Native package validation**.
It builds Windows x64, Linux x64 (DEB/RPM/tar.gz), and Mac ARM64/x64 on native
GitHub-hosted runners. Each job uploads only its build/checksum report.
Installers stay on the ephemeral runner while binary distribution review remains
pending. This workflow neither creates a Release nor supplies
upgrade-acceptance receipts to `Draft release`.

1. Set the repository variable `PUBLIC_RELEASE_REPOSITORY` to the final public repository's `owner/name`. The workflow must exist on the default branch before its manual entry appears in Actions.
2. Protect `release/*`, prohibit force pushes and restrict updates to maintainers. Protect `v*`; prohibit moving or deleting published tags.
3. Create the `public-release` Environment in advance, configure **Required reviewers**, restrict deployment to protected release branches and disable administrator bypass. Configure self-review according to team responsibilities. Preflight checks the actual reviewer gate through the GitHub API and fails if it is missing; it does not rely on YAML to create the environment automatically.
4. Keep `GITHUB_TOKEN` read-only by default. Only the draft upload job receives `contents: write` and `actions: read`. Do not configure company credentials, cluster addresses, private registries, upload tokens or SSH keys. PR jobs receive no release credentials; these workflows do not use `pull_request_target` or self-hosted runners.
5. Allow the official checkout/setup/artifact actions pinned to commit SHAs. Artifacts are downloaded from the current run; final publication uses the candidate's immutable artifact ID. Candidates are retained for 30 days and must be approved before expiry. Expired or missing artifacts require a new candidate, not receipts borrowed from another run.

## Release procedure

1. Create one unified `release/X.Y.Z` branch from reviewed public source. Client and Hub use the same X.Y.Z version; the version is recorded in receipts and written to Hub OCI labels.
2. Manually run **Draft release** on that branch with the matching component and version. Build and accept each candidate once. A source fix creates a new SHA and requires a new candidate.
3. The final job creates a **Draft Release only**, targeting the accepted SHA. It downloads every uploaded asset with authentication and verifies its digest. It never publishes the draft and does not require creating a formal tag first. An existing tag must point to the accepted SHA.
4. Maintainers with access to draft releases download and test the candidate internally. Draft assets are not anonymous public downloads. The workflow contains no public-publish command; publishing later requires an explicit, separate maintainer action after internal testing.
5. Never rebuild or overwrite accepted assets. Retry the draft job after a network failure: a draft from the same run can resume, while another candidate or an already public Release is rejected. For a new candidate of the same version, explicitly review and remove the obsolete draft first.
6. Use `component: all` to build Client and Hub together with one shared quality/security gate and one manifest. Individual components are diagnostic subsets and cannot be merged into another run's draft. Preserve the accepted SHA for the eventual `vX.Y.Z` tag.
7. After publication, merge the release branch back into `main` while preserving its history, then create the next `release/X.Y.Z` branch from the updated mainline. Bump the Client package, lockfile and renderer versions together. Pin the six desktop upgrade baselines to the previous public release's original asset URLs, sizes and SHA-256 digests; the baseline version must be strictly older than the new candidate.

When preparing the public repository, reviewed source may be squashed into `public` without private development history, old tags or internal artifacts. The source exporter creates a ZIP from the committed tree, generates its manifest from the archived bytes, and verifies the archive before returning it. The manifest is not tracked in Git.

## Binary publication gates

Review and commit genuine resolution evidence for `third-party/public-release.json`: original licenses, corresponding source archives and actual artifact inventories. Then update the distribution scope in `PUBLIC-SOURCE.json`. Do not simply clear pending items to make CI pass.

Client desktop acceptance requires six entries in `tools/ci/soduwork-acceptance-baselines.json`: `windows-x64-exe`, `linux-x64-deb`, `linux-x64-rpm`, `linux-x64-tar.gz`, `macos-arm64-dmg` and `macos-x64-dmg`. Each entry includes `productName: SoduWork`, a strictly older `version`, `sha256`, and a `url` pointing to the same public GitHub repository, with optional `format`/`size`. Local paths and internal fallback downloads are rejected. For desktop 1.13.15 only, the committed `firstRelease` contract replaces upgrade acceptance with fresh install, restart, reinstall, ciphertext/data persistence and uninstall checks. The older 1.13.13 packages belong to SoduWork Global: the Mac bundle is `SoduWork Global.app`, Windows uses `Uninstall SoduWork Global.exe`, and the Linux DEB package is `soduwork-global`. Global migration is explicitly unsupported. The exception applies only to the six desktop keys listed in the contract and never to subsequent versions. Linux acceptance runs an unlocked synthetic GNOME Keyring inside a D-Bus session and rejects plaintext fallback. Never substitute the candidate as an older version to claim a successful upgrade.

Hub images are delivered as Release assets. After downloading and verifying the manifest, run `docker load --input <image.tar.gz>` and configure your environment using the [self-hosting guide](../ops/self-host/README.md). This workflow does not push to GHCR or migrate company cluster deployment, backup schedules, domains or update services.

## Local validation

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tools/github -p 'test_*.py'
python -m unittest tools.dev.test_source_export tools.dev.test_deploy tools.security.test_scan_secrets
python tools/github/check_public_ci.py
node --test tools/check-public-source.test.cjs tools/source-manifest.test.cjs tools/check-docs.test.cjs
node tools/check-public-source.cjs
node tools/check-docs.cjs
actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml
```

Application source changes still require full regression checks for affected modules. Review and commit new files before exporting. Do not generate or commit a source manifest in a checkout. In an extracted exporter-produced ZIP, run `node tools/check-source-manifest.cjs` to verify the generated inventory. Public-source, secret and third-party checks remain independent of archive integrity.

Release procedures, workflow documentation and contribution templates are maintained in English.
